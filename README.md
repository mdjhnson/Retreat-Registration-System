# Retreat-Registration-System


I want to be sure to create a system that:
1. Takes info from one spreadsheet to another and routes desired data to the desired columns.
2. Many regions will use because it is flexible to their use case
3. Is not overwhelming for non-technical staff
4. Requires no technical support to implement / troubleshoot
5. Can be used for different events
